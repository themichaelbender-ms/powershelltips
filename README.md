# powershelltips
This is a community-driven repository of secrets/tips/tricks for using PowerShell. All community members are free to submit suggestions, additions, and changes through pull requests.

The idea for this project came from a tweet thread on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MichaelBender/status/1095394513500205056?s=20) asking people for tips & tricks for beginners to learn PowerShell, and the things that "turn on the lightbulbs". 

Version 1.0
This version will be simply a collection of all of the suggestions from Twitter, so there will be little organization at the outset. As time allows, items will be organized, linked to relevant resources, and fleshed out. The end goal is to create a dynamic resource for PowerShell users.
